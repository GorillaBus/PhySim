# Vector

A set of tools to handle vector mathematic operations for computer graphics.

This is work in progress and I develop and upload as I go on studying and experimenting with phisics and computer graphics.

Right now there are a Vector and a Particle class with wich you can simulate forces and objects being affected (like gravity, wind, etc).

The actual gravity method (second version) lets you simulate gravity between objects, for example, planets, stars, etc. Althought it is a ver simple vector methodology it's handy and fun (check gravity demo).

I'm including some demos in the src/demos/ directory.

While I work on this project I also learn TDD so you may find you can do "npm test" to run all tests.

Â¡Feedback is always welcome!
